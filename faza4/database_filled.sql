There are some quality of life improvements in the UI, some new multiplayer-centric activities, but overall it plays the same as the previous game. That itself is not a bad thing, as obviously the devs stick to the tried-and-tested formula that works. But this time it feels like they played it too safe. Who knows, maybe the DLC will introduce more new content and changes, while the devs focus until now was to get the base game done ready for the November release slot.\r\n\r\nTo sum up:\r\n- If you haven\'t played Horizon 4, buy that one on sale instead of 5. It looks almost as good, it\'s sold at a good discount, it has more content and less bugs, and the online community is still active.\r\n- if you liked Horizon 4 or you want to run with the cool kids and play the newest game, then I can recommend Horizon 5.\r\n- if you didn\'t like previous Horizon games, there\'s nothing new here that will change your mind.', 4),

Warframe is a mostly PVE third person shooter action game with parkour elements flawlessly integrated into the gameplay. You have seen games do parkour before of course, but these are space ninjas we\'re talking about, which means you can basically fly around the stage at high speed while letting loose a torrent of bullets, rockets and/or high-energy plasma, or just take out your trusty sword/hammer/fists and cripple anything in your path.\r\n\r\nWhat will you face? Humanoids, robots, aliens, you name it. Yes, there are bosses, and they can and will kick your butt.\r\nWhat will you face them with? Hundreds, and I mean HUNDREDS of weapons to choose from.

(8, 2, 'I haven’t seen very many qualitative reviews yet, so I’m attempting my own. This is based on what I’ve experienced in the game so far playing three hours on my Xbox One and on Steam altogether.\r\n\r\nA turn-based strategy game, you can build a team of up to six characters with their own customized equipment. Everyone can have different weapons, some with effects and some that are strong against enemies wearing particular equipment. An example of this is that swords will be weak against people with helmets but maces will be strong against them. While customizing you character, you will see a bar graph which tells you their equip load, damage, range, defense, and dodge. Going above 100% equip load will reduce the character’s move points by one, and staying below 50% grants an additional move point. You can designate one person on your team as the hero. Doing so gives them more health, damage, and greater equip load.\r\n\r\nThe combat is fairly simple. Move your melee team members adjacent to enemies, and they will attack them. Ranged team members supposedly need at least one empty space between the enemy and themselves. If there are multiple enemies that can be targeted within the vicinity, that unit will seemingly choose a random enemy to strike. Some of the fights can take a few minutes depending on how fast your thinking is when it comes to moving your team.', 5),

The combat consists of choosing a place to move your character and letting them choose who to attack. I feel like if I could even just choose who they hit it wouldn\'t be so bad, but in its current state playing the actual game-play is mind numbing at best.', 3),

Getting back to the topic of Fallout 3, this game is good. Is it Fallout: New Vegas levels of good? No. It’s still good nonetheless. The story was very okay. It was interesting enough but I didn’t think was written too well and it doesn’t compare to New Vegas. The game doesn’t shine in its main questline but where it does shine is in some of its side quests and the atmosphere/exploring.\r\n\r\nI’ve already spoken of the main questline but it follows you, a former vault resident, who escapes in search of his father. The intro mission itself was great. It set up relationships and it showed part of living in a vault. After this, the main quest kind of goes downhill. It doesn’t end up horrible but it gives no reason to care for the characters and the only motivation for me was to see it through as the plot was interesting enough. The story isn’t as open as NV in choice and it doesn’t have factions or anything like that. It pretty much forces you to see one faction as all good and another as all bad but even then, it doesn’t let you join the evil faction.

So I played this game even before it was brought to Steam, back in the days it was on Blizzard\'s Battle Launcher. I like to think that I\'m a veteran in terms of the information I have on the game, both lore-wise and mechanics-wise. (Even if I\'m still sh*t at PvP, but that\'s between us...). So I will pass onto you some of the main things to know about the game before starting it. And I hope you will enjoy it!', 3),

I played a good bit of D1 and a lot of D2 and this Expansion is at least on par with TTK and Forsaken, which are considered among the best updates. I myself had fun playing the campaign and learning about the lore for the first time in Destiny. The game still has some issues but compared to when I left it, feels like a 180 in the right direction.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the experience for new players still isn\'t well structured and fails to offer a clear and all around cohesive way into the mid/endgame for most people. The community has got your back tho and provides great tools to help players along the way (these are more or less required, if you want to enjoy your experience in the long run, easy to find via google).\r\nPlaying with randos is a bit hit and miss, which is not unusual but soloing is definitely a viable and fun option. Nevertheless having a premade group or at least some reliable steam buddies, certainly improves almost every aspect of the game.\r\n\r\nThe game still looks great but for a lot of people the performance seems to have worsened over the last few months or years. Not the case for me, 5700XT, 5800X, 32 GB RAM, SSD - 1440p @ ~120fps. I cannot play at maxed out settings but high to highest + some increased Render Resolution depending on the content.', 4),

I don\'t know where the idea of an invading force of chickens came from, but many games have drawn from strange sources when creating enemies and objectives. It hasn\'t seemed to put people off, and may have been the sort of oddity that lured people in long enough to try it and find enjoyable.\r\n\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\nWith the title drawing from Space Invaders, the gameplay is similar in that CI2 is a SHMUP, and the enemy force loads in at the start of each wave. However, there\'s no bases to hunker behind for protection. Your defense is best exhibited with a strong offense, which is granted through various projectile styles and upgrades you can pick up. There are 3 different weapon types: red bullets that spread out across the screen, a tighter cluster of green waves, and a thinner laser beam. Personally, I preferred anything other than the spread-out bullets, because the attacks were so weak. You also have a limited amount of rockets, which are best reserved for later in the game, as the difficulty increases.', 4),
